Just In Time RPG Rules:

CHARACTER BUILDING:
  You have 5 status with 25 points to distribute, min 3 - max 8 each.
  You must also create a background story as base for your character.
 
  Each of the 5 status has a modified given as `%-5` where `%` is the status value.
  This modifier is used to measure the character fitness on different tasks.
  
  The status are: Dexterity, Agility, Intelligence, Life and Strength.

  Some special values are tied to these stats:
   - Dodge Points: 1/turn for each Agility point.
   - Mana Points: 1/turn for each Inteligence point.
   - Hit Points: 2 for each Life point.
END

CHANCE TESTS:
  For any task that requires some effort from the character, the master may require a Chance Test.
  A Chance Test fails if you get on a d20 dice a value lower than the test difficulty.

  The dice value is added to:
   - The modifier related to the test (the specific modifier being defined by the game master)
   - Any Karma effects (explained on the `Karma` section).
   - Any Lucky Points spent. (explained on the `Lucky` section)
   - Any Skill bonus that applies to the test. (explained on the `Skills` section)
  
  For Attack tests, I advise using the Dexterity modifier,
  since this is why this status exists. For other tests you name it.
END

ATTRIBUTE TESTS:
  For any activity that requires some effort of the character and where
  one specific attribute is specially decisive, the master may require an attribute test.

  Attribute tests should also be used when characters dispute strength, charisma or magic power.
  In these tests the difficulty is given by the oponnent, thus wins the one with the best score on the test.

  The dice used in an attribute test may vary by the master's decision.
  The valid values are: d4, d6, d8, d10 and a d12.
  (Suggestion: use always a d8 as to simplify the gameplay)

  An attribute test fails if you score less than the test difficulty.

  The given value is added to:
   - The respective attribute modifier.
   - Lucky Points spent. (explained on the `Lucky` section)
   - Any skill bonus that applies to the test. (explained on the `Skills` section)

   -- Skills that modify attribute tests should cost 3 times more than Chance Tests.
      (the same apply for Lucky points)

  Some common attribute tests:
   - Weightlifting: d8 + Strength modifier.
   - Poison resistance: d8 + Life modifier.
   - Magic resistance: d8 + Intelligence modifier.
   - Dodge an object: d8 + Agility modifier.
   - Grab/deflect a moving object: d8 + Dexterity modifier.
END ATTRIBUTE TESTS

LUCKY:
  Lucky points are earned for making good role play, the master should use it as reward for fun players.
  // This points are for the master to bargain with, but always use it to promote funny role-playing.

  The players should also get some lucky points from time to time, e.g. after a day, or after an important battle.
  I suggest a maximum storage capacity of lucky points (e.g. 10-20) so the players are encouraged to use them.

  These points (as described above) can be added to dices outcomes on `chance` and `attribute` tests.
  To do that the players must spend these lucky points making them a valuable resource.
  
  Spend Lucky points is subject to Weight 3. (explained on `Weight` section)
END

DAMAGE:
  Each character's damage defaults to a d6.

  Each hit should only happen after a Chance Test:
   - Long ranged tests should have a standard difficulty of 15.
   - Short ranged tests should have a standard difficulty of 12 or 13.
   (both may vary -2 or +2 to express an easy or hard target.
   (extremely easy or hard tests difficulty is up to the master to decide)

Examples:
  Hit a fast moving target is a bow: 13 (15 - 2)
  Hit an opponent with a club while jumping from a cliff: 15 (13 + 2)
  Hit a paralized opponent with a mace: 10 (12 - 2)

  Hit a flying dragon in the eye with a dagger: 35 (15 + wtf)
END

DEFENSE:
  If a given attack passes the Chance Test it will hit the character defense.
  The first line of defense is the character's dodge points (1 for each Agility point)
  In a single turn a character with 5 Agility can dodge up to 5 points of damage. Not necessarily from the same source.
  The second line of defense, are any effects of defensive skills. (explained in the `Skills` section)
  The last defensive line is the character Hit Points (given by the Life attribute)
  
  Characters with 0 HP are still awake but, can't attack and walk slowly (crawling).
  Characters with HP < 0 are unconscious.
  Characters abandoned in an open field while unconscious should be expected to die.
  Characters with N Life points will be considered dead if they hit `-(N + 1)` HP.

  Notes:
   - To avoid dodging a character should have a good role-play excuse,
     since it would not be natural for a human do to so.
     (if he wants to do that often, he should learn a skill to do so)
END

SKILL POINTS
  The skill points rule define characters abilities, talents and proficiencies.
  They should represent any aspect of the universe not handled by the other rules.
  This design allows the game to be as complex as the game master wants and still be fun.

  All skill candidates should be reasoned in terms of:
   1. The character background (a character should only have skills that make sense on his background story)
   2. The master's common sense and good judgement.
   3. The `Weight` rule explained in the next section.
  
  Skill points represent the growth of the character, and should be earned after completing challenges.
  Its up to the gamemaster to create the rules of any new skill and make it fair.

  Base models for Designing Skills:
   - +1 damage on each attack, cost 1 SP
   - +1 armor on each defense, cost 1 SP
   - +1 critical hit chance on `Chance Tests` with a given weapon, cost 1 SP
   
   - +1 d4 of damage (as a second weapon), cost 2 SP (each dice represents 1 weapon, so at most 2 at the same time)
   - Upgrade weapon from a d4 to a d6, cost 1 SP
   - Upgrade weapon from a d6 to a d8, cost 1 SP
   - Upgrade weapon from a d8 to a d10, cost 1 SP
   - Upgrade weapon from a d10 to a d12, cost 1 SP
   
   - Spend a turn to heal 1 of own's HP, cost 1 SP
   - Spend a turn to heal 1 HP from any character, cost 2 SP
   
   - Upgrade a skill to target up to +1 adjacent characters, cost 3 SP (the effect being split between targets)
   
   - Upgrade a skill to work twice in the same turn: cost 5 SP

   To upgrade any skill you should also increase its price proportionally.
   If the players wants something overpower make an overpriced skill, so to always keep balance.
   
  Just In Time Creation rules:
    - A player should `declare` some basic skills at the beginning of the game.
    - A player can `declare` a previously non existing skill to exist at --anytime--,
      as long as he has enough SP and it makes perfect sense in the role playing of his character.
    - A player can `learn` a new skill or `upgrade` an existing skill after an event or a battle,
      As long as he have enought SP and he can link it with role play consistently.

    Examples:
    - A farmer boy cannot `declare` he is good at using crossbows, but he can learn it during gameplay.
    - At the same time a hunter can `declare` he knows how to light a fire in the woods, it makes perfect sense for him.
    - One cannot declare he is immune to poison, if on the last battle he was poisoned, since it would break game play.
    - One cannot upgrade a skill in the middle of battle, but he can do it just after that.

  New skills can be of any type, it is strongly encouraged the negociation of these skills between the game master and the players,
  so that the characters come out exactly how the player wished for when he designed his character. This makes the player happier
  and more willing to play his character.

  In other words creating a skill is a job for 2, but the final word is always from the game master.

  The game master should be flexible and creative, this text is to be used as base, but be free to alter it.
  After all if the system is exactly how you wished for you will be happier and more willing to play as game master.

  As a final advice, you should understand well the "Weight" concept described below.
  And use it in appropriate dosages for each new skill.
END

WEIGHT
  Weight is a rule created to facilitated game balancing.
  Any skill if improved too much will cause unforseen effects on the game.
  To prevent those effects they should all be subject to the Weight effect:
  
  E.g.: 
    - +1 critical chance, costs 1 SP.
    - +2 costs 2 SP (1 + 1)
    - +3 costs 3 SP (2 + 1).
      From +4 on ward it starts to get overpower, so the price should be increased a little:
    - +4 costs: 5 (3 + 2)
    - +5 costs: 7 (5 + 2)
    - +6 costs: 9 (7 + 2)
      Now it is getting abnormal for a normal human being, lets make it even more expensive:
    - +7 costs: 12 (9 + 3)
      So to upgrade from +2 to +3 I would spend only 1 SP,
      to do the same from +6 to +7 I would spend 3 SP.
  
  Therefore the Weight effect of N or `WN` for short increases the `upgrade` cost by 1 every N `upgrades`.
  On the example above the Weight used was W3, and it is a fairly good Weight to use as default.
  
  For most cases including all the examples on the `Skill Points` section I suggest the use of W3.
  If you find it more appropriate to use a heavier or lighter Weight be free to do it.
END 

KARMA:

  Some rules should not be easy to change. To change them would
  provide a player with a greatly unfair advantage or disadvantage.

  To fix this problem the Karma Points system allow a player to
  exchange some advantages for some proportional disadvantages:

  Karma points:
   - Have +1 status point to use costs 1 KP
   - Have -1 status point to use provides 1 KP
   - Having more than 8 status points on a single attribute costs 1 KP
   - Having less than 3 status points on a single attribute provides 1 KP
   All these rules are subject to Weight 1

  Examples:
   - A player wants to be an incredibly strong but dumb beserker;
     He could have 9 points in Strength, and only 2 in Inteligence.
   - A player wants a character that has 4 hands, so he can use a total of 4 weapons.
     A gamemaster could require one KP for each extra arm.
   - A player wants to be a hobbit, with less HP than normal, it is fair that
     he can sell that 2 HP for 1 Karma.

FIM

MODIFICADORES:

  Cada um dos 5 status tem um modificador que é dado pelo valor real do status-5.
  Esse modificador é usado em testes para representar a habilidade do usuário.
